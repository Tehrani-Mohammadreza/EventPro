Creating the Event Model:
Copilot assisted in defining the Event model by suggesting appropriate data annotations for validation. For example, it recommended the [Required] annotation to ensure that fields like Name, Description, Date, and Location are filled out, and the [StringLength(100)] annotation to limit the length of the event name. These suggestions helped enforce proper data validation without manual effort.

Event Card Component & Data Binding:
Copilot suggested the creation of the Event form, using Blazor's data-binding features. It proposed the use of @bind to bind the input fields (e.g., @bind="newEvent.Name") to the model's properties, enabling two-way data binding. This allowed the form to automatically update the model when the user interacts with the input fields and vice versa.

Routing and Navigation:
Copilot helped generate the routing logic for the application. It suggested the correct use of @page directives for defining URLs (e.g., /create-event, /edit-event/{id}). Additionally, it assisted in using NavigationManager.NavigateTo() for redirecting users to other pages after submitting or editing events. This streamlined the navigation setup between the different pages in the application.

Error Handling:
Copilot provided suggestions for handling errors effectively. It proposed the use of try-catch blocks when interacting with the EventService to manage event creation and updating. Copilot also suggested displaying error messages to users by binding the error message string to the UI, ensuring that users are informed of any issues during event processing.

Form Validation & Submission:
Copilot recommended the use of Blazor's EditForm with DataAnnotationsValidator and ValidationSummary to handle form validation. It suggested the best practices for handling form submission (OnValidSubmit="HandleCreateEvent") and ensuring that the event data is only processed when the form is valid, reducing the chance of invalid data entering the system.

State Management:
Copilot aided in managing the state of the newEvent and existingEvent models. It suggested initializing the model with default values and binding the form inputs to the model's properties. This state management ensured that user input was tracked correctly and updated the model as needed.

Performance Improvements:
While the project was relatively simple, Copilot suggested efficient patterns for asynchronous data fetching, such as using Task.FromResult to return event data quickly without blocking the UI thread. This practice helped ensure the app remained responsive even during data retrieval operations.
